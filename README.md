A sort function with multithreading process and fast-io implementation which is suitable for low-end computers with a little memory(<2gb RAM).

This can be implemented by using hard-drive instead of RAM but the process should be slower beacause of interacting with hard-drive, that's why we need fast io for the program.

The program has 3 arguments which is inputFile(string), outputFile(string) and memoryLimit(int, calculated in bytes).

REQUIREMENT: MINGW Compiler, after you install it, you wil be able to run the project by terminal using g++ command.
